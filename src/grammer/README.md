% Grammar

# Introduction

This document is the primary reference for the Rust programming language grammar. It
provides only one kind of material:

  - Chapters that formally define the language grammar.

This document does not serve as an introduction to the language. Background
familiarity with the language is assumed. A separate [guide] is available to
help acquire such background familiarity.

This document also does not serve as a reference to the [standard] library
included in the language distribution. Those libraries are documented
separately by extracting documentation attributes from their source code. Many
of the features that one might expect to be language features are library
features in Rust, so what you're looking for may be there, not here.
