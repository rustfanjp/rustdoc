% Byte string literals

##### Byte string literals

A non-raw _byte string literal_ is a sequence of ASCII characters and _escapes_,
preceded by the characters `U+0062` (`b`) and `U+0022` (double-quote), and
followed by the character `U+0022`. If the character `U+0022` is present within
the literal, it must be _escaped_ by a preceding `U+005C` (`\`) character.
Alternatively, a byte string literal can be a _raw byte string literal_, defined
below. A byte string literal of length `n` is equivalent to a `&'static [u8; n]` borrowed fixed-sized array
of unsigned 8-bit integers.

Some additional _escapes_ are available in either byte or non-raw byte string
literals. An escape starts with a `U+005C` (`\`) and continues with one of the
following forms:

* A _byte escape_ escape starts with `U+0078` (`x`) and is
  followed by exactly two _hex digits_. It denotes the byte
  equal to the provided hex value.
* A _whitespace escape_ is one of the characters `U+006E` (`n`), `U+0072`
  (`r`), or `U+0074` (`t`), denoting the bytes values `0x0A` (ASCII LF),
  `0x0D` (ASCII CR) or `0x09` (ASCII HT) respectively.
* The _backslash escape_ is the character `U+005C` (`\`) which must be
  escaped in order to denote its ASCII encoding `0x5C`.
