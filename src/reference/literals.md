### Literals

A literal is an expression consisting of a single token, rather than a sequence
of tokens, that immediately and directly denotes the value it evaluates to,
rather than referring to it by name or some other evaluation rule. A literal is
a form of constant expression, so is evaluated (primarily) at compile time.
