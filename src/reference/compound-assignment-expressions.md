% Compound assignment expressions

#### Compound assignment expressions

The `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>` operators may be
composed with the `=` operator. The expression `lval OP= val` is equivalent to
`lval = lval OP val`. For example, `x = x + 1` may be written as `x += 1`.

Any such expression always has the [`unit`](#tuple-types) type.
