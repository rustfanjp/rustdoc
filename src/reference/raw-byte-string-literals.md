% Raw byte string literals

##### Raw byte string literals

Raw byte string literals do not process any escapes. They start with the
character `U+0062` (`b`), followed by `U+0072` (`r`), followed by zero or more
of the character `U+0023` (`#`), and a `U+0022` (double-quote) character. The
_raw string body_ can contain any sequence of ASCII characters and is terminated
only by another `U+0022` (double-quote) character, followed by the same number of
`U+0023` (`#`) characters that preceded the opening `U+0022` (double-quote)
character. A raw byte string literal can not contain any non-ASCII byte.

All characters contained in the raw string body represent their ASCII encoding,
the characters `U+0022` (double-quote) (except when followed by at least as
many `U+0023` (`#`) characters as were used to start the raw string literal) or
`U+005C` (`\`) do not have any special meaning.

Examples for byte string literals:

```
b"foo"; br"foo";                     // foo
b"\"foo\""; br#""foo""#;             // "foo"

b"foo #\"# bar";
br##"foo #"# bar"##;                 // foo #"# bar

b"\x52"; b"R"; br"R";                // R
b"\\x52"; br"\x52";                  // \x52
```
