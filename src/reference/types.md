## Types

Every variable, item and value in a Rust program has a type. The _type_ of a
*value* defines the interpretation of the memory holding it.

Built-in types and type-constructors are tightly integrated into the language,
in nontrivial ways that are not possible to emulate in user-defined types.
User-defined types have limited capabilities.
