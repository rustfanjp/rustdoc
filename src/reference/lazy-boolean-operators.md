% Lazy boolean operators

#### Lazy boolean operators

The operators `||` and `&&` may be applied to operands of boolean type. The
`||` operator denotes logical 'or', and the `&&` operator denotes logical
'and'. They differ from `|` and `&` in that the right-hand operand is only
evaluated when the left-hand operand does not already determine the result of
the expression. That is, `||` only evaluates its right-hand operand when the
left-hand operand evaluates to `false`, and `&&` only when it evaluates to
`true`.
