### Expression statements

An _expression statement_ is one that evaluates an [expression](#expressions)
and ignores its result. The type of an expression statement `e;` is always
`()`, regardless of the type of `e`. As a rule, an expression statement's
purpose is to trigger the effects of evaluating its expression.
