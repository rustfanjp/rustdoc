% Machine types

#### Machine types

The machine types are the following:

* The unsigned word types `u8`, `u16`, `u32` and `u64`, with values drawn from
  the integer intervals [0, 2^8 - 1], [0, 2^16 - 1], [0, 2^32 - 1] and
  [0, 2^64 - 1] respectively.

* The signed two's complement word types `i8`, `i16`, `i32` and `i64`, with
  values drawn from the integer intervals [-(2^(7)), 2^7 - 1],
  [-(2^(15)), 2^15 - 1], [-(2^(31)), 2^31 - 1], [-(2^(63)), 2^63 - 1]
  respectively.

* The IEEE 754-2008 `binary32` and `binary64` floating-point types: `f32` and
  `f64`, respectively.
