% Mutable statics

#### Mutable statics

If a static item is declared with the `mut` keyword, then it is allowed to
be modified by the program. One of Rust's goals is to make concurrency bugs
hard to run into, and this is obviously a very large source of race conditions
or other bugs. For this reason, an `unsafe` block is required when either
reading or writing a mutable static variable. Care should be taken to ensure
that modifications to a mutable static are safe with respect to other threads
running in the same process.

Mutable statics are still very useful, however. They can be used with C
libraries and can also be bound from C libraries (in an `extern` block).

```
# fn atomic_add(_: &mut u32, _: u32) -> u32 { 2 }

static mut LEVELS: u32 = 0;

// This violates the idea of no shared state, and this doesn't internally
// protect against races, so this function is `unsafe`
unsafe fn bump_levels_unsafe1() -> u32 {
    let ret = LEVELS;
    LEVELS += 1;
    return ret;
}

// Assuming that we have an atomic_add function which returns the old value,
// this function is "safe" but the meaning of the return value may not be what
// callers expect, so it's still marked as `unsafe`
unsafe fn bump_levels_unsafe2() -> u32 {
    return atomic_add(&mut LEVELS, 1);
}
```

Mutable statics have the same restrictions as normal statics, except that the
type of the value is not required to ascribe to `Sync`.
