% Byte literals

##### Byte literals

A _byte literal_ is a single ASCII character (in the `U+0000` to `U+007F`
range) or a single _escape_ preceded by the characters `U+0062` (`b`) and
`U+0027` (single-quote), and followed by the character `U+0027`. If the character
`U+0027` is present within the literal, it must be _escaped_ by a preceding
`U+005C` (`\`) character. It is equivalent to a `u8` unsigned 8-bit integer
_number literal_.
